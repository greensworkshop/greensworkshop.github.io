<h2 id="theme--goals">Theme &amp; Goals</h2>

<p>Robotics is one of the most challenging domains for software engineering. Deploying even simple applications requires integrating solutions from experts of various domains, including navigation, path planning, manipulation, localization, human-robot interaction, etc. Integration of modules contributed by respective domain experts is one of the key challenges in engineering software-centric systems, yet only one of the cross-cutting software concerns crucial to robotics. As robots often operate in dynamic, partially observable environments additional challenges include adaptability, robustness, safety, and security.</p>

<p>The goal of RoSE 2019 is to bring together researchers from participating domains with practitioners to identify new frontiers in robotics software engineering, discuss challenges raised by real-world applications, and transfer latest insights from research to industry.
RoSE 2019 will solicit contributions from both academic and industrial participants, thus fostering active synergy between the two communities.</p>

<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of Interest</h2>

<p>RoSE 2019 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following
topics related to robotics software engineering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analysis of challenges in robotic software engineering</li>
  <li>Architectures that lead to reusable robotic software</li>
  <li>Challenges for defining and integrating domain-specific languages for the design of robotic systems</li>
  <li>Continuous integration and deployment in robotics</li>
  <li>Identification and analysis of design principles promoting quality of service (e.g., performance, energy efficiency)</li>
  <li>Engineering the collaboration of multiple (heterogeneous) robots</li>
  <li>Machine learning for safety-critical robotic systems</li>
  <li>Metrics to measure non-functional properties (e.g., robustness, availability, etc.) and their application in robotic software</li>
  <li>Best practices in engineering robotic software</li>
  <li>Variability, modularity, and reusability in robotic software</li>
  <li>Validation and verification of robotic software</li>
  <li>Processes and tools supporting the engineering and development of robotic systems</li>
  <li>State-of-the-art research projects, innovative ideas, and field-based studies in robotic software engineering</li>
  <li>Lessons learned in the engineering and deployment of large-scale, real-world integrated robot</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="keynote">Keynote</h2>

<p>We are happy to have Prof. <a href="http://www.professeurs.polymtl.ca/giovanni.beltrame/">Giovanni Beltrame</a> of the Department of Computer and Software Engineering of the École Polytechnique de Montréal giving a keynote talk on “Gathering swarms: programming large-scale robotic networks”.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

<p>We are currently on the verge of a new technology
revolution—autonomous robots are becoming more and more present in our
everyday lives. From drones to self-driving cars, these systems are
becoming pervasive, and are acting as an enabling technology for many
kinds of safety-critical applications. Examples of robotic applications
are search-and-rescue operations, industrial and agricultural
inspection, autonomous car driving, aerial mapping, monument
digitization, and surgery.  Despite this ambitious vision, the major
achievements in the area of swarm robotics still consist of algorithms
that tackle specific problem instances, and the performance of these
algorithms strongly depends upon the context in which they are
developed. Given this state of affairs, reproducing results and
comparing algorithms is difficult, hindering the development of swarm
robotics as a whole.  This talk will provide an overview of the current
challenges and potential solutions that aim at programming (and
maintaining) thousands of robots in a safe and manageable way.  In
particular, the presentation will showcase new languages, paradigms, and
methods for the development and deployment of complex swarm behaviors,
as well as giving practical examples in the area of disaster response
and space exploration.</p>

<h3 id="vita">Vita</h3>

<p>Giovanni Beltrame obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from
Politecnico di Milano, in 2006 after which he worked as microelectronics
engineer at the European Space Agency on a number of projects spanning
from radiation-tolerant systems to computer-aided design. In 2010 he
moved to Montreal, Canada where he is currently Professor at
Polytechnique Montreal with the Computer and Software Engineering
Department. He was also Visiting Professor at the University of Tübingen
in 2017/2018. Dr. Beltrame directs the MIST Lab, with more than 30
students and postdocs under his supervision. He has completed several
projects in collaboration with industry and government agencies in the
area of disaster response and space exploration. He is the principal
investigator for the first university-made CubeSat in Quebec, and
scientific director of the Quebec Nanosatellite Constellation
project. His research interests include modeling and design of embedded
systems, artificial intelligence, and robotics, on which he has
published research in top journals and conferences.</p>
