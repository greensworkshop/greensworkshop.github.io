<h2 id="theme-goals">Scope</h2>
<p>
  The engineering of green software-intensive systems is critical in our drive
  towards a sustainable, smarter planet. The goal of green software engineering
  is to apply green principles to the design and operation of software-intensive
  systems.
  <b
    >Green and self-greening software systems have tremendous potential to
    decrease energy consumption.
  </b>
  Moreover, software can and should be re-thought to address sustainability
  issues using innovative business models, processes, and incentives. Monitoring
  and measuring the greenness of software is critical towards the notion of
  sustainable and green software. Demonstrating improvement is paramount for
  users to achieve and effect change. Analysis of the sustainability of a
  specific software system requires software that aids developers in weighing
  the four dimensions of sustainability---economic, social, environmental, and
  technical---with their attendant trade-offs. The software engineering
  community must assume leadership in this important challenge. In this
  workshop, we will explore the theme of “green software engineering for
  software sustainability” with a goal towards creating actionable outcomes that
  will affect how software engineering is practiced and taught in the future, in
  order to help organizations prioritize their sustainability objectives.

<h2 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Paper Submission:</b><s>20 Oct 2025</s> 27 Oct 2025</li>
  <li><b>Notification:</b> 24 Nov 2025</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>Participants are invited to submit three types of contributions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Emerging research papers (up to 8 pages):</strong> These describe
    contributions offering novel research results, addressing challenging
    real-world problems with innovative ideas. Submissions should clearly
    describe the challenges and problems tackled, the relevant state of the art,
    the solution being offered, and the potential benefits of the contribution,
    from an academic or industrial perspective.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Position papers (up to 5 pages):</strong> Contributions outlining
    forward-looking ideas or thought-provoking reflections that call for further
    discussion and research in the community. These describe a specific position
    or opinion of the authors or provide a well-reasoned and motivated vision.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Extended abstracts (up to 2 pages):</strong> These abstracts propose
    novel research topics for discussion in the community, addressing
    challenging problems from an academic or industrial perspective. The
    motivation for the topic is grounded in the literature or practical
    experience. These are free of article processing charge (APC).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All papers must be submitted electronically via the
  <a href="https://icse2026-greens.hotcrp.com/">HotCRP</a> submission system by
  the submission deadline and must not have been published before or be
  submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration at GREENS. All
  submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the
  official
  <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"
    >“ACM Primary Article Template”</a
  >, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template page. LaTeX users
  should use the sigconf option, as well as the review (to produce line numbers
  for easy reference by the reviewers). To that end, the following LaTeX code
  can be placed at the start of the LaTeX document:
  <code>\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}.</code>
  Submissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings formatting
  instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other
  changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection
  without further review. All papers will go through a
  <b>single blind</b> submission process and will be reviewed on the basis of
  technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program
  committee members. The workshop proceedings will be published in ICSE 2026
  Companion proceedings.
