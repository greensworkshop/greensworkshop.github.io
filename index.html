<h2 id="theme-goals">Theme &amp; Goals</h2>
<p>
The engineering of green software-intensive systems is critical in our drive towards a sustainable, smarter planet.
The goal of green software engineering is to apply green principles to the design and operation of software-intensive systems.
<b>Green and self-greening software systems have tremendous potential to decrease energy consumption.</b>
Moreover, enterprise software can and should be re-thought to address sustainability issues using innovative business models, processes, and incentives.
<i>Monitoring</i> and <i>measuring</i> the greenness of software is critical towards the notion of sustainable and green software.
Demonstrating improvement is paramount for users to achieve and effect change.
Analysis of the sustainability of a specific software system requires <i>software that aids developers in weighing the four dimensions of sustainability</i> – economic, social, environmental, and technical – with their attendant trade-offs.
The software architecture community must assume leadership in this important challenge. In this workshop we will explore the theme of <i>“architectural implications of green software”</i> with a goal towards creating actionable outcomes that will affect how software architecture is practiced and taught in the future.

<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of Interest</h2>
<p>GREENS 2025 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the
following topics related to sustainable software and software for
sustainability:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Architectural implications (architectural tactics, architectural
		styles, design patterns and anti-patterns) for green and sustainable
		software</li>
		<li>Practices for sustainability-aware software architecture</li>
		<li>Metrics and measures for sustainability-aware software
		architecture</li>
		<li>Sustainability-aware architectures in context (e.g., cloud-edge
		continuum)</li>
		<li>Teaching and training of skills and competences in
		sustainability-aware software architecture</li>
		<li>Sustainable computing from a software architecture and
		software-intensive system perspective</li>
		<li>Applied, or experimented with, software engineering methodologies at
		all levels (from requirements elicitation to architecture design,
		coding, testing)</li>
		<li>Conceptual reflections related to software sustainability</li>
		<li>Progress on the various dimensions of software sustainability and
		their interplay</li>
		<li>Software adaptation for sustainability</li>
		<li>Tools to support sustainability-aware decision making</li>
		<li>Sustainability of emerging computing technologies (AI systems, edge
		devices)</li>
		<li>Green AI, lighter, less data-intensive and less energy-consuming AI
		models and architectures</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h2>
<ul>
  <!-- <li><b>Abstract Submission (Optional):</b> November 11, 2024</li> -->
	<li><b>Paper Submission: </b> November 11, 2024</li>
	<li><b>Paper Notification: </b>December 8, 2024</li>
	<li><b>Camera-Ready: </b>TBD</li>
	<li><b>Workshop Date: </b>TBD</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>Participants are invited to submit three types of contributions:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Emerging research papers (up to 8 pages)</strong>:
	These should describe contributions offering novel
	research results, addressing challenging real-world problems with
	innovative ideas. Submissions should clearly describe the challenges and
	problems tackled, the relevant state of the art, the solution being
	offered, and the potential benefits of the contribution, from an
	academic or industrial perspective.</li>

	<li><strong>Position papers (up to 5 pages)</strong>:
	These should be contributions outlining forward-looking
	ideas or thought-provoking reflections that call for further discussion
	and research in the community. These should describe a specific position
	or opinion of the authors, or provide a well-reasoned and motivated
	vision.</li>

	<li><strong>Extended abstracts (up to 2 pages)</strong>: These
	abstracts should propose novel research topics for discussion in the
	community, addressing challenging problems from an academic or
	industrial perspective. The motivation for your topic should be grounded
	in the literature or in practical experience.</li>
</ul>

  <!-- All papers are to be submitted electronically via the <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=greens2024">EasyChair</a> submission system by the submission deadline and must not have been published before or be submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration at GREENS. Papers must follow the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Computer Science proceedings format</a>, but will use a single blind submission process. All papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee members. The workshop proceedings will be published in ICSA 2024 Companion proceedings and appear in IEEE Xplore Digital Library. -->
