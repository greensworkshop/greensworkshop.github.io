- Blended 
- May X-Y, 2023 (two days, envisioned)

- Please indicate your intent to participate [here](https://forms.gle/loremipsum)

## Theme & Goals

The engineering of green software-intensive systems is critical in our drive towards a sustainable, smarter planet. The goal of green software engineering is to apply green principles to the design and operation of software-intensive systems. Green and self-greening software systems have tremendous potential to decrease energy consumption. Moreover, enterprise software can and should be re-thought to address sustainability issues using innovative business models, processes, and incentives. Monitoring and measuring the greenness of software is critical towards the notion of sustainable and green software. Demonstrating improvement is paramount for users to achieve and effect change. Analysis of the sustainability of a specific software system requires software that developers weigh four dimensions of sustainability – economic, social, environmental, and technical – with their attendant trade-offs. The software engineering community must assume leadership in this important challenge. In this workshop we will explore the themes of design representation, curriculum design, and standards with a goal towards creating actionable outcomes that will affect how software engineering is practiced and taught in the future.


## Topics of Interest

GREENS 2023 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following
topics related to sustainable software and software for sustainability:
- TBD


## Submission Guidelines 
Prospective participants are invited to submit three types of contributions:
- Extended abstracts (up to 2 pages)
- Position papers (up to 5 pages)
- Emerging research papers (up to 8 pages)

Workshop papers must follow the [ICSE 2023 formatting instructions](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2023/icse-2023-technical-track), but will use a *single blind* submission process. All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee. All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the [EasyChair workshop website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=greens2023). Accepted papers will become part of the workshop proceedings.

## Important Dates 
- Workshop paper submissions due: January 13, 2023 (AoE time)
- Notification to authors: February 24, 2023 (AoE time)
- Camera-ready copies due: March 17, 2023 (AoE time)
- Workshop: TBA

<!--
- Full papers (max 8 pages) will describe concrete contributions to the GREENS. They will be structured as follows:
--- A description of the sustainability problem you address.
--- A description of the SE solution you propose.
-- A discussion of how results are measurable (e.g., KPIs).
-- A presentation of the evidence of contribution to sustainability, ideally including real world experiences.
-- A discussion of the costs and benefits of your approach.
-- A presentation of the transferable artifacts you are contributing e.g., replication package, code, examples, documentation, educational materials, case studies.

- Extended abstracts (max 2 pages) will describe a motivating challenge problem that has ideally emerged from practice. They will be structured as follows:
-- The context.
-- The challenge problem.
-- The current solution/s (if present) and their strengths and weaknesses.

<p><img src="/img/pierrebourque.jpg" width="200" /><a href="https://profs.etsmtl.ca/pbourque">Pierre Bourque</a> - ing., Ph.D.</p>

**Lessons Learned from Building and Gaining Consensus on the SWEBOK Guide** - The proof of concept document of the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) was made available in 1998—now more than 20 years ago. The speaker has played a key role in all published versions, as lead author of the proof of concept document or Straw Man version, co-editor of the Trial Version published in 2001 and of the 2004 version, and lead editor of SWEBOK Version 3.0 published in 2014. Based on the speaker’s experience in this initiative and some reflections on the actual impact of the SWEBOK Guide, this keynote presentation will convey some of the lessons learned and challenges of building, updating and gaining consensus on a body of knowledge.  The speaker will notably address the importance of defining the scope, objectives, and intended audiences, obtaining funding, using an open process, building partnerships with sponsors, professional societies and standardization organizations, assuring wide availability and following an iterative approach.

**Short Bio** - Pierre Bourque is a faculty member since 2000 in the Department of Software and IT Engineering of the École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) of the Université du Québec in Canada. He recently completed a sabbatical (2019-2020) in industry after being Dean of Studies at ÉTS (2013-2019). He is also lead editor of the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) V3 published in 2014 and was co-editor of the 2001 and 2004 versions. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Ulster (Northern Ireland). He is the 2020 recipient of the Nancy Mead Award for Excellence in Software Engineering.
