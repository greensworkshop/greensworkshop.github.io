# 8th International Workshop on Green and Sustainable Software (GREENS'24) 

- Co-located with [ICSA 2024](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2024)
- TBD (one day)
- Registration [here](https://conf.researchr.org/attending/icsa-2024/registration)

## Theme & Goals

The engineering of green software-intensive systems is critical in our drive towards a sustainable, smarter planet. The goal of green software engineering is to apply green principles to the design and operation of software-intensive systems. Green and self-greening software systems have tremendous potential to decrease energy consumption. Moreover, enterprise software can and should be re-thought to address sustainability issues using innovative business models, processes, and incentives. Monitoring and measuring the greenness of software is critical towards the notion of sustainable and green software. Demonstrating improvement is paramount for users to achieve and effect change. Analysis of the sustainability of a specific software system requires software that developers weigh four dimensions of sustainability – economic, social, environmental, and technical – with their attendant trade-offs. The software engineering community must assume leadership in this important challenge. In this workshop we will explore the themes of design representation, curriculum design, and standards with a goal towards creating actionable outcomes that will affect how software engineering is practiced and taught in the future.


## Topics of Interest

GREENS 2024 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following
topics related to sustainable software and software for sustainability:
