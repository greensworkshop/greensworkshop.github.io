### Themes and topics

Engineering green software-intensive systems is critical in our drive towards a sustainable, smarter planet. The goal of green software engineering is to apply green principles to the design and operation of software-intensive systems. Green and self-greening software systems have tremendous potential to decrease energy consumption. Moreover, enterprise software can and should be re-thought to address sustainability issues using innovative business models, processes, and incentives. Monitoring and measuring the greenness of software is critical towards the notion of sustainable and green software. Demonstrating improvement is paramount for users to achieve and affect change. The **GREENS 2018** theme is _design patterns and reference architecture for green and sustainable software_. Analysis of the sustainability of a specific software system requires software developers weigh four major dimensions of sustainability – economic, social, environmental, and technical – affecting their related trade-offs. The software engineering community must assume leadership in this important challenge.  
  
The **GREENS 2018** workshop is the sixth instance of the workshop, all organized in conjunction with the [International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)](http://icse2018.org/), and brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss both the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in green software, including novel ideas, research challenges, methods, experiences, and tools to support the engineering of sustainable and energy efficient software systems.  
  
**GREENS 2018** encourages contributions from industry, government, and academia on all topics related to greener software engineering. Topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Requirements and design methods for green software
*   Design primitives and principles for green software
*   Best practices to increase energy efficiency and sustainability (including software and process improvement)
*   Instrumentation and monitoring software systems for key green indicators (KGIs) and green improvement
*   Energy efficiency of mobile apps
*   Energy efficient software for mobile robotic systems
*   Energy-aware adaptation of software-intensive systems
*   Energy challenges and solutions in cyber physical systems
*   Energy efficient IoT and sensor networks
*   Self-adaptive and self-managing systems for green computing
*   Green architectural knowledge, green design patterns
*   Sustainable data management
*   Monitoring, verification and validation of green software
*   Creating user awareness about energy consumption
*   Analytics tools for green decision making
*   Green key performance indicators
*   Quality and risk assessments, tradeoff analyses between energy efficiency, sustainability and traditional quality requirements
*   Business models for green software (e.g., SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, and cloud computing)
*   Formulating challenges for a green software industry
*   Return on investments and economic aspects of green software development
*   Case studies, empirical studies, and industry experience reports
*   Incentives to invest in greener software

### Contributions

**GREENS 2018** welcomes research papers, industrial experience papers, and tool presentations; nevertheless, papers describing novel research contributions and innovative applications are of particular interest. Contributions can be:

*   **Regular papers** (maximum 8 pages): contributions proposing novel research results, addressing challenging problems with innovative ideas, discussing a specific position or opinion of the authors, or providing a sufficiently documented visions. Regular papers should clearly describe the challenges and problem tackled, the relevant state of the art, the position or solution suggested and the potential benefits of the contribution, from both an academic and an industrial perspective.
*   **Industrial experience papers** (maximum 4 pages): contributions describing the results of industrial case studies or industrial experiences coming from companies where software sustainability is taken into strong consideration. Authors of papers reporting industrial experiences are strongly encouraged to make their experimental results available for use by reviewers.
*   **Tool demo papers** (maximum 4 pages): contributions presenting innovative tools specifically tailored to green and sustainable software. Tool demo papers should explain enhancements made in comparison to previously published work. Authors of tool demonstration papers should make their tool available for use by reviewers.

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three Program Committee members with joint discussion to reach agreement on an optimal selection. All accepted contributions will be published published by ACM. Accepted papers must be presented by at least one of the authors. The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2018. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  

### Submission

Papers can be submitted via EasyChair: [http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=greens2018](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=greens2018)  
Each paper must be submitted in PDF and be formatted according to the [ACM formatting instructions](https://www.icse2018.org/track/icse-2018-Double-blind-review#Formatting).

### Joakim Ponten: Power-aware software systems (Help saving the world with IoT & AI)"

#### Abstract

The energy system of the future is coming fast, two-thirds of all added power production to the grids in 2016 were renewables, the average annual growth rate of photovoltaic power production is 68% over the last 10 years, in countries such as Denmark and Sweden the vast surplus of electricity during windy days causes negative prices. The amount of energy will become abundant, but at the same time the power supply will become volatile, the wind may stop and the sun may not shine. When renewable power production supply falls short prices will spike and fossil power generation will be used to cover the deficiency. Solutions that are aware of the power supply can be both more sustainable and more cost efficient. Scheduling loads in accordance with the power supply will allow solutions to reduce their carbon footprint and save money for their users. Battery backed systems such data-centers and mobile network base stations can even provide services to the grid to help keeping it in balance. Ericsson is developing and partnering to implement systems that both supports and leverages the energy systems of tomorrow. We are using our expertise in connectivity, IoT and machine intelligence to drive the development of tomorrows sustainable business models.

  

#### Biography

[Joakim Ponten](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joakim-pont%C3%A9n-53524b134) is a Senior IoT Solution Architect at Ericsson, working with designing the IoT solutions for a variety of industries. He is currently working as the Chief Solution Architect of the Fossil Free Energy Districts project, a collaboration project of nine partners funded by the EU’s ERDF UIA program. Joakim believes in the in potency of combining the big data sets of IoT with the capabilities of machine learning, and that it is crucial to create and use technology to produce financial incentives for individuals and corporations to do good.
