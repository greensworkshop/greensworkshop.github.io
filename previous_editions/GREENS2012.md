First International Workshop on Green and Sustainable Software
--------------------------------------------------------------

– 3rd June 2012 –

_**In conjunction with ICSE 2012**_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_**Motivation and Goals**_

ICT accounts for approximately 2% of world CO2 emissions, a figure equivalent to aviation, according to Gartner estimates. In fact, this 2% includes (only) the ‘in-use phase’ of hardware: in the remaining 98% software both operationalizes the private sector in doing its business and the public sector in supporting society, as well as delivering end-user applications that permeate our personal lives.  
Software can contribute to decrease power consumption (i.e. become greener) in at least two ways. First, by being more energy efficient, hence using lesser resources and causing fewer CO2 emissions. Second, by making its supported processes more sustainable, i.e. decreasing the emissions of governments, companies and individuals. To this end, enterprise software must be completely rethought to address sustainability issues and support sustainable & innovative business models and processes.  
Creating greener software is the focus of GREENS 2012 with special theme ‘Green Knowledge for Sustainable Software Engineering.’ It brings together software engineering researchers and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in green software, as well as research challenges, novel ideas, methods, experiences, and tools to support the engineering of sustainable and energy efficient software systems.
